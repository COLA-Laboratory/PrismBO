In mathematical optimization, the Ackley function is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It was proposed by David Ackley in his 1987 PhD dissertation. The function is commonly used as a minimization function with global minimum value 0 at 0,.., 0 in the form due to Thomas BÃ¤ck. While Ackley gives the function as an example of "fine-textured broadly unimodal space" his thesis does not actually use the function as a test.
