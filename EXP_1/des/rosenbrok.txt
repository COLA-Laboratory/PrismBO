In mathematical optimization, the Rosenbrock function is a non-convex function, introduced by Howard H. Rosenbrock in 1960, which is used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It is also known as Rosenbrock's valley or Rosenbrock's banana function. The global minimum is inside a long, narrow, parabolic-shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial. To converge to the global minimum, however, is difficult.
